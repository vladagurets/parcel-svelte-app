## Get started

Install deps...

```bash
npm i
```
or with yarn
```bash
yarn
```

...then start [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/):

with npm
```bash
npm run dev
```
or with yarn
```bash
yarn
```

Navigate to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.


## Building production

npm run build
```
or with yarn
```bash
yarn build
```

then all sources will be in dist folder.


####  Preparations for autodeployment to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
1. Create new branch on Github (skip if it's already done)
2. Link remote repo to your local git repo (skip if it's already done)
3. Create empty branch with name **gh-pages** and remove all files in this branch
4. Switch to **master** and update **homepage** and **repository** properties in **package.json**
5. Go to your **Github Developer Settings** -> **Personal access tokens** and create new token for your CD process. Don't forget to check all checkboxes in **repo** section
6. After the key is created, copy it to a safe place, we'll need it
7. After go to the **Your Repo Settings** -> **Secrets** and past value from prev step into **Value** input. Set secret name to **MY_DEPLOY_KEY** (you can use any name but be sure to use your own name in next steps)
8. Go to page of your repo, click on **Github Actions** and click on **Set up a workflow yourself**
9. Copy instructions from **workflow.example.yml** in your repo and update **YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL**, **YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME**, **YOUR_REPO_NAME** values. Also update **MY_DEPLOY_KEY** to your own name (if it was changed in prev steps).
10. Commit your changes. Deployment will start soon

Autodeployment will trigger on each push to **master** branch.
After a little while **(be patient)** your application will be available on https://YOUR_GITHUB_NAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME url.
